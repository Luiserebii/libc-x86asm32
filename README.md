# libc-x86asm32
An attempt to implement libc in x86 ASM (32-bit).

## Building
Running `make` will create a `.so` library to link against in the root. For static linking, `build/` should be populated with the respective `.o` object files needed.

## Testing
The test directory has... something, but it needs to be improved (needs testing framework)
